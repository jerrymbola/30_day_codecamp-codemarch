    <h1>The Wonders of Nature</h1>
    <h2>Exploring the Beauty of Our Planet</h2>
    <p><strong>Earth</strong> is a home to a myriad of <em>amazing</em> wonders, from vast oceans and towering mountains
        to dense forests and deserts. In this blog post, we'll take a closer look at some of the most <u>incredible</u>
        natural phenomena our planet has to offer.</p>

    <h3>The Great Barrier Reef</h3>
    <p>Located off the coast of <strong>Queensland, Australia</strong> the <em>Great Barrier Reef</em> is the largest
        coralsyetem in the world. It stretches over 2,300 kilometers (1,400 miles) and is home to a diverse array of
        marine life, including more than 1,500 species of fish, 411 types of hard coral, and 30 species of whales and
        dolphins.</p>

    <blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html"">The Great  Barrier Reef is a site of remarkable variety and beauty on the north-east coast of Australia. It contains the world's largest collection of coral reefs with 400 types of coral, 1,500 species of fish and 4,000 types of mollusk. <br>

    <h3>The Amazon Rainforest</h3>
    <p>The <b>Amazon Rainforest</b> is the world's largest tropical rainforest, covering an area of approximately 6.7 million square kilometers (2 million square miles) in South America. In fact, it is estimated that <del>one-third</del> <ins>one-fifth</ins> of all known species on our planet can be found in the Amazon.</p>

    <p>One fascinating fact about the Amazon Rainforest is that it produces <q>20% of the world's oxygen</q> and plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate. However, it is also under threat from <sub>deforestation</sub> and climate change, which could have devastating consequences for the entire planet.</p>

    <h3>Mount Everest</h3>
    <p>Standing at an impressive 8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet) above sea level, <strong>Mount Everest</strong> is the highest peak on Earth.</p>
    
    <p>Despite the many challenges and risks associated with climbing Mount Everest, it remains a popular destination for adventure-seekers from around the world. In fact, it is estimated that over <sup>4,000</sup> people have successfully reached the summit since Sir Edmund Hilary and Tenzig Norgay first did so in 1953.</p>
